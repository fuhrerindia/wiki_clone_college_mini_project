                Wikipedia has no central editorial board. Contributions are made by a large number of volunteers at
                their own discretion. Edits are neither the responsibility of the Wikimedia Foundation (the organisation
                that hosts the site) nor of its staff and edits will not generally be made in response to an email
                request.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although Wikipedia was founded by Jimmy Wales, he is not personally responsible for our content.
                If you have questions about the concept of Wikipedia rather than a specific problem, the About Wikipedia
                page may help.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to ask other users for help with editing or using Wikipedia, stop by the Teahouse,
                Wikipedia's live help channel, or the help desk to ask someone for assistance.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you disagree with an article's content, or are involved in a content dispute, see Dispute resolution.
                The links on the left should direct you to how to contact us or resolve problems. If you cannot find
                your issue listed there, you can email helpful, experienced volunteers at info-en@wikimedia.org. Please
                refrain from emailing about disagreements with content; they will not be resolved via email.

            <h2>Readers</h2>
            <p>
                Wikipedia is written almost exclusively by volunteers — people from across the world, just like you.
                This means that sometimes it contains incorrect information, either accidentally or deliberately.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you find some incorrect information, there are a few things you can do.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, you can fix it yourself! Anyone can edit Wikipedia. Just hit the "edit" button on the top right
                of the page, make the correction, and hit "Publish changes". If you want to learn more about editing,
                try our help pages.
                If you can't or don't want to fix an error, your best approach is to leave a note at the talk page of
                the article explaining the problem.
                For vandalism, it is best just to fix it directly yourself; however, if you cannot fix it, you can email
                info-en-v@wikimedia.org and include the address or title of the article and a description of the
                vandalism.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also email the Wikipedia Volunteer Response Team at info-en-o@wikimedia.org, although we may not
                be able to assist with all suggestions. That list is managed by a small group of volunteers. If you do
                email, please include the address or title of the article and a description of the issue. Note that this
                volunteer team cannot assist you in writing entirely new articles, answering questions about things not
                found on Wikipedia, or resolving disputes about content.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we don't have an article on what you're looking for, you can add it to the list of requested
                articles. This unfortunately doesn't necessarily mean that it will be written immediately, or ever. If
                we do have an article but it doesn't include what you were looking for, or you just want the answer to a
                specific question, you can ask at the reference desk: our volunteers are always happy to help!
            </p>
            <h2>Article Subject</h2>
            <p>
                Wikipedia articles are maintained by volunteer editors; there is no centralised review system. Editors
                interested in your article can be reached by leaving a note on the article's "talk" page. This can be
                found by clicking the "talk" link at the top of your article. Once you're there, click the "new section"
                tab to the right of that. This will create a new section, where you can post your specific comments or
                concerns - put {{Edit COI}} at the top of your new section, then explain what you'd like to see changed
                in the article. Finally, click "Publish changes". Check back periodically for responses, but be patient.
            </p>
            <h2>Licensing</h2>
            <p>
                Do you want to use something you've found on Wikipedia? Wikipedia is a freely licensed encyclopedia;
                most of our content can be copied and used for any purpose. The exception to this is content used as
                "fair use". Fair use media is clearly identified if you go to the page about that file; you should see
                that the file is identified as "fair use under United States copyright law. Other uses of this image, on
                Wikipedia or elsewhere, might be copyright infringement" in the "Licensing" section. Fair use text
                should be marked explicitly as a quotation. All other content should be freely licensed and open for
                your use as long as you meet the licensing conditions. For specifics, see our page on reusing Wikipedia
                content. We try hard to identify the sources and licenses of all media such as text, images or sounds
                used in our encyclopedia articles. Still, we cannot guarantee that all media are used or marked
                correctly. If an image description page states that an image was in the public domain, you should still
                check yourself whether that claim appears correct and decide for yourself whether your use of the image
                would be acceptable under the laws applicable to you.
            </p>
            <h2>Donors</h2>
            <p>
                Wikipedia and its fellow sites are hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organisation based
                in the United States. Sites like Google or Yahoo are hosted on thousands of servers, with thousands of
                employees; we have around 800 servers and around 350 staff, and cover our costs through donations—almost
                all from members of the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're interested in donating to Wikipedia, you can do so here. If you've got questions about where
                your money goes, what we spend it on or what our plans are for the future, you can find out here. Should
                you have any problems donating, or other questions, please email donate@wikimedia.org .

                room contains more information, along with materials about Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation, and
                other projects it hosts.

            <p>
                If you work for an organisation that is interested in a cultural partnership with Wikipedia, the
                Wikimedia Foundation, or one of its affiliated bodies, there is an outreach page on cultural
                partnerships where you can propose new ones or get in touch with experienced outreach volunteers. For
                business development opportunities or proposals, please contact business@wikimedia.org .
